- [ ] An In-depth Look at Claude Code _ Features, Pricing, and Usage (2025-06-26) ➕ 2025-06-26 


### What is Claude Code's "Plan Mode"?

Claude Code's "Plan Mode" is a feature that separates the planning and analysis of coding tasks from the actual execution of code. This mirrors the workflow of experienced engineers by prioritizing strategy and approval before implementation.

#### Key Features of Plan Mode

* **Read-Only Operations**: In Plan Mode, Claude Code can analyze your codebase, inspect files, and gather information but cannot edit files, run system-altering commands, or change configurations.
* **Structured Workflow**:
    1.  **Research Phase**: Claude gathers information using read-only tools.
    2.  **Plan Creation**: It drafts a detailed implementation plan.
    3.  **Plan Presentation**: The plan is presented to the user for review.
    4.  **User Approval**: The user must approve or request changes to the plan.
    5.  **Execution Phase**: Only after approval does Claude execute the plan and make changes.
* **No Unintended Changes**: This mode ensures no modifications are made to your environment or codebase without explicit user approval.

#### Practical Workflow Example: "Prime, Map, Plan"

1.  **Prime**: Set clear rules for Claude (e.g., only plan, do not edit until approved).
2.  **Map**: Have Claude scan and summarize the project structure.
3.  **Plan**: Ask Claude to draft a markdown implementation plan for review before any code is written.

#### Why Plan Mode is Important
* **Reduces Risk**: Prevents accidental or premature changes.
* **Improves Clarity**: Ensures all stakeholders are aligned on the plan.
* **Boosts Productivity**: Minimizes mistakes and back-and-forth communication.
