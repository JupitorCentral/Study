**Using MCP with Local PostgreSQL vs. Supabase for Database Management**

### What are the options for using a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with a database, specifically comparing a local PostgreSQL setup with Supabase?

The core decision is between using Supabase's managed cloud service or a self-hosted PostgreSQL database. While Supabase offers a convenient Backend-as-a-Service platform, using a local PostgreSQL instance with an enhanced MCP server provides greater control and avoids cloud-related limitations.

#### Supabase Overview

- **Backend-as-a-Service:** A platform built on PostgreSQL that provides auto-generated APIs (REST/GraphQL), real-time capabilities, authentication, and file storage.
    
- **Managed Infrastructure:** Hosted on Supabase's cloud servers, which includes storage limits and is subject to their pricing tiers. It is distinct from a local PostgreSQL setup as you utilize their hardware and compute resources.
    

#### Supabase Pricing (2025)

- **Free:** $0/month for 50K monthly active users, 500MB database, and 5GB bandwidth.
    
- **Pro:** $25/month for 100K monthly active users, 8GB database, and 250GB bandwidth.
    
- **Team:** $599/month, offering SOC2/HIPAA compliance and SSO.
    
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing is available.
    
- **Compute Scaling:** Ranges from $10 to $3,730 per month for various CPU and RAM configurations.
    

### MCP Server Options for Database Management

#### 1. Official Supabase MCP Server

- **Full project management:** Allows for creating and dropping tables, schema modifications, and migrations.
    
- **Data manipulation:** Supports INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
    
- **Project-level operations:** Enables creating projects, branches, and more.
    
- **TypeScript type generation:** Available.
    
- **Requirement:** A Supabase cloud project is necessary.
    

#### 2. Official @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres

- **Read-only access:** Designed for safety, this server only allows for querying data and exploring schemas.
    
- **Limitations:** Does not permit table creation, data manipulation, or schema changes.
    
- **Compatibility:** Works with any PostgreSQL database, whether local or in the cloud.
    

#### 3. Enhanced PostgreSQL MCP Servers

##### @henkey/postgres-mcp-server (Recommended)

- **Comprehensive Tools:** Features 17 intelligent tools for complete database management.
    
- **Full CRUD Operations:** Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting data through natural language commands.
    
- **Schema Management:** Allows for creating, modifying, and dropping tables, as well as performance analysis.
    
- **Compatibility:** Works with a local PostgreSQL database.
    

##### Postgres MCP Pro (crystaldba)

- **Configurable Access:** Offers different modes for various use cases.
    
- **Unrestricted Mode:** Provides full read and write access.
    
- **Restricted Mode:** Ensures safety for production environments.
    
- **Compatibility:** Works with a local PostgreSQL database.
    

### Solution for Local PostgreSQL + MCP

#### Setup with @henkey/postgres-mcp-server:

```bash
npm install -g @henkey/postgres-mcp-server
```

#### Gemini CLI Configuration (.gemini/settings.json):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgresql-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@henkey/postgres-mcp-server",
        "--connection-string", "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Benefits of This Approach

- **Data Sovereignty:** Keep your data stored locally on your machine's PostgreSQL instance.
    
- **No Limits:** Avoid storage limitations and pricing tiers associated with cloud services.
    
- **Full AI-Powered Control:** Gain complete database manipulation capabilities through artificial intelligence.
    
- **Supabase-like Functionality:** Achieve the capabilities of the Supabase MCP without being dependent on the cloud.
    
- **Natural Language Interface:** Interact with your database using natural language via the Gemini CLI.
    

### Final Recommendation

For developers who want Supabase MCP-like functionality while retaining full control over their data and infrastructure, the recommended solution is to use **@henkey/postgres-mcp-server** with a local PostgreSQL database.
