It is not accurate to understand Node.js simply as a framework that can execute JavaScript code. The essence and characteristics of Node.js can be more accurately described as follows:

1. Runtime Environment: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of the browser
2. JavaScript Engine Based: It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
3. Server-Side Development: Through Node.js, you can develop server-side applications using JavaScript
4. Asynchronous I/O: Node.js provides efficient performance using an asynchronous, event-driven I/O model
5. NPM: Various libraries and tools can be easily used through Node Package Manager
6. Extended Functionality: You can perform tasks that are impossible in a browser environment, such as file system access and network communication

Therefore, it is more accurate to understand Node.js not as a simple framework, but as a powerful runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be executed on the server side.
