- [ ] What is React âž• 2025-06-26 

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. Here are the key points about React:

1. Purpose: It's used for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces for web applications.
2. Development: Originally developed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2013.
3. Component-based: React uses a component-based architecture, allowing developers to build reusable UI components.
4. Virtual DOM: It implements a virtual DOM for efficient rendering and updating of the user interface.
5. JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript.
6. Unidirectional data flow: React follows a one-way data binding model, making it easier to track and debug changes in applications.
7. Ecosystem: It has a large ecosystem of tools, libraries, and extensions, including React Native for mobile app development.
8. Performance: Known for its high performance in rendering complex user interfaces.
9. Popularity: As of 2024, it's one of the most widely used front-end libraries, with strong adoption in both small and large-scale applications.
10. Learning curve: While it requires some learning, its popularity means there are abundant resources for developers.

React is primarily focused on the view layer of applications and is often used in conjunction with other libraries or frameworks for full-stack development.
