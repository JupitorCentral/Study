- [ ] Event Sourcing, Kafka, and Spring Implementation Patterns ➕ 2025-07-22 

### What is the Event Sourcing pattern and how is it related to the event-store-service module of this project?

Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern that persists the full history of changes as a sequence of immutable events, providing a robust audit trail and enabling state reconstruction. Instead of storing just the current state of data, event sourcing stores every change (event) that has occurred to the system as an ordered sequence of events.

#### Key characteristics of Event Sourcing:

- **Immutable event log**: All changes are recorded as events that cannot be modified.
    
- **State reconstruction**: The current state can be rebuilt by replaying events from the beginning.
    
- **Complete audit trail**: Every action in the system is preserved for compliance and debugging.
    
- **Time-travel capabilities**: System state can be viewed at any point in time.
    

#### How event-store-service Relates to Your Banking Project

The `event-store-service` module is the central component that implements event sourcing in your banking system. It serves as the central repository for all banking events and maintains the complete history of all system changes.

#### Core Responsibilities

- **Event Storage**: Captures and stores all transaction and domain events from across the banking system.
    
- **Event Replay**: Enables reconstruction of system state by replaying stored events.
    
- **Audit Trail**: Provides an immutable record of all banking operations for regulatory compliance.
    
- **State Recovery**: Supports system recovery and debugging by maintaining a complete event history.
    

#### Integration with CQRS Architecture

In your banking system, the `event-store-service` works within the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern:

- **Command Side**: Write operations (account creation, transactions) generate events that are stored in the event store.
    
- **Query Side**: Read operations can be optimized using projections built from the event store.
    
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Events from the store trigger updates across different modules via Kafka messaging.
    

#### Technical Implementation

The `event-store-service` in your project uses:

- **MongoDB** for flexible event storage due to its schema flexibility for diverse event structures.
    
- **Kafka integration** for real-time event streaming and message queuing.
    
- **Spring Boot** framework for the service implementation in Kotlin.
    

#### Related Topics Worth Exploring

- Event Store database design patterns
    
- Event versioning and schema evolution
    
- Snapshotting for performance optimization
    
- Event replay strategies and performance considerations
    
- Integration patterns with other microservices
    

### So, my event store service captures all transactions and stores their information to the DB, correct?

Yes, exactly! Your `event-store-service` captures all transactions and domain events and stores them in the database, but it's a bit more sophisticated than just storing transaction information.

#### What Gets Captured

Your `event-store-service` captures:

- **Banking transactions** (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)
    
- **Account lifecycle events** (account creation, closure, status changes)
    
- **Authentication events** (login attempts, password changes)
    
- **Administrative actions** (user management, configuration changes)
    
- **System events** (error conditions, service interactions)
    

#### How It Works

The service doesn't just store raw transaction data—it stores **immutable events** that represent what happened:

```plaintext
Instead of: "Account balance = $500"
It stores: "MoneyDepositedEvent: $100 deposited to Account123 at 2025-07-22T19:08:00"
```

#### Key Benefits

- **Complete audit trail**: Every action is permanently recorded.
    
- **State reconstruction**: You can rebuild any account's current state by replaying its events.
    
- **Regulatory compliance**: Banks need detailed transaction histories for auditing.
    
- **Debugging capability**: You can trace exactly what happened when issues occur.
    
- **Time travel**: View account state at any point in history.
    

#### Database Storage

In your MongoDB implementation, each event is stored as a document containing:

- **Event type** (e.g., "AccountCreated", "MoneyTransferred")
    
- **Event data** (amount, account IDs, timestamps)
    
- **Metadata** (event ID, correlation ID, version)
    
- **Timestamp** (when the event occurred)
    

This gives you a permanent, unchangeable record of everything that happens in your banking system—much more powerful than just storing current balances!

### How can this be actually implemented? Don't show the codes, just tell me the method. I know my project uses Kafka, and these are implemented using Spring's dependencies that support Kafka. Do we implement this capturing modules by defining Spring beans?

Yes, **Spring beans are the primary mechanism** for implementing event capturing modules in your banking system. Here's how the architecture typically works:

#### Core Implementation Strategy

1. Event Producers as Spring Beans
    
    Your banking services (account service, transaction service) are implemented as Spring beans that automatically capture and publish events when business operations occur. Each service bean:
    
    - Handles business logic (create account, process transaction).
        
    - Automatically generates events for state changes.
        
    - Uses injected Kafka producers to publish events.
        
    - Maintains transactional consistency between database writes and event publishing.
        
2. Kafka Template Integration
    
    Spring provides KafkaTemplate as a bean that gets auto-configured and injected into your services. This template:
    
    - Handles serialization and message formatting.
        
    - Manages connection pooling to Kafka brokers.
        
    - Provides **transactional publishing** to ensure events are only sent when database operations succeed.
        
    - Supports **idempotent producers** to prevent duplicate events.
        
3. Event Listeners for Processing
    
    Your event-store-service uses @KafkaListener annotated beans to consume events from topics. These listener beans:
    
    - Automatically deserialize incoming events.
        
    - Store events in MongoDB with proper metadata.
        
    - Handle **acknowledgment patterns** to ensure reliable processing.
        
    - Support **manual offset management** for better control.
        

#### Spring Boot Auto-Configuration Benefits

##### Automatic Bean Registration

Spring Boot's **auto-configuration** handles most of the heavy lifting:

- `ConsumerFactory` and `ProducerFactory` beans are created automatically.
    
- Kafka admin clients for topic management.
    
- Error handlers and retry mechanisms are configured as beans.
    
- Health checks and metrics through Spring Actuator integration.
    

##### Configuration-Driven Setup

You define behavior through `application.yml` properties rather than extensive code:

- Consumer group settings and acknowledgment modes.
    
- Retry policies and error handling strategies.
    
- Serialization formats and schema registry integration.
    
- **Transactional settings** for exactly-once processing.
    

#### Event Store Service Architecture

##### Repository Pattern Implementation

Your `event-store-service` implements **Spring Data repositories as beans**:

- `EventRepository` for MongoDB operations.
    
- Projection builders that create read models from events.
    
- Event replay services that can reconstruct state from stored events.
    

##### Integration with Application Events

Spring's `ApplicationEventPublisher` allows your system to:

- Publish domain events locally within the same service.
    
- Use `@TransactionalEventListener` for reliable event processing.
    
- Coordinate between local transactions and Kafka publishing.
    

#### Transaction Management Strategy

##### Two-Phase Publishing Approach

The most robust implementation uses **Spring's transaction management**:

- Database transaction commits first (account balance update).
    
- Event publishing happens in a separate phase with compensation logic.
    
- Saga patterns handle cross-service transaction consistency.
    
- The Outbox pattern ensures events are eventually published even if Kafka is temporarily unavailable.
    

This approach leverages Spring's **declarative transaction management** through annotations and bean proxying, making the event capture process transparent to your business logic while ensuring data consistency across your banking system.

### So, there should be a @Service bean and that bean must call Kafka. Then, by defining another Spring bean, can I capture that transaction which happened inside that @Service bean? I mean, I can't think about how I can actually implement this.

Yes, you can absolutely capture transactions from a `@Service` bean using another Spring bean! Here are the main implementation patterns:

#### Method 1: Application Events with `@EventListener`

Your `@Service` bean publishes events internally, and another bean listens to them:

```kotlin
@Service
class BankingService(
    private val applicationEventPublisher: ApplicationEventPublisher,
    private val kafkaTemplate: KafkaTemplate<String, Any>
) {
    fun processTransaction(transaction: Transaction) {
        // Business logic
        saveToDatabase(transaction)

        // Publish internal event
        applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(TransactionEvent(transaction))
    }
}

@Component
class TransactionEventListener(
    private val kafkaTemplate: KafkaTemplate<String, Any>
) {
    @EventListener
    fun handleTransactionEvent(event: TransactionEvent) {
        // Capture the transaction and send to Kafka
        kafkaTemplate.send("transaction-events", event.transaction)
    }
}
```

#### Method 2: AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) Interception

Create an aspect that intercepts method calls on your `@Service` bean:

```kotlin
@Aspect
@Component
class TransactionCaptureAspect(
    private val kafkaTemplate: KafkaTemplate<String, Any>
) {
    @AfterReturning("@within(org.springframework.stereotype.Service)")
    fun captureServiceCall(joinPoint: JoinPoint) {
        // Capture method execution and send to Kafka
        val event = createEventFromMethodCall(joinPoint)
        kafkaTemplate.send("service-events", event)
    }
}
```

#### Method 3: Transactional Event Listeners

For better consistency, use `@TransactionalEventListener` to ensure events are only published after database transactions commit:

```kotlin
@Component
class TransactionEventCapture {
    @TransactionalEventListener(phase = TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMMIT)
    fun handleTransactionCommit(event: TransactionEvent) {
        // Only sends to Kafka after DB transaction succeeds
        kafkaTemplate.send("committed-transactions", event)
    }
}
```

#### Method 4: Spring Boot Kafka Integration Pattern

Your `event-store-service` can listen to these captured events:

```kotlin
@Service
class EventStoreService {
    @KafkaListener(topics = ["transaction-events"], groupId = "event-store")
    fun captureTransactionEvent(event: TransactionEvent) {
        // Store in MongoDB event store
        eventRepository.save(event.toEventDocument())
    }
}
```

The **Application Events approach** is typically the cleanest for your banking system since it maintains loose coupling and leverages Spring's built-in event infrastructure.

##### Additional topics to explore:

- Event ordering and idempotency handling
    
- Outbox pattern for guaranteed event delivery
    
- Event schema evolution strategies
    
- Dead letter queue configuration
    

### In Method 1, how is the transaction action intertwined with event capture? I need an explanation of each line. I think `event: TransactionEvent` is related to the `processTransaction` method somehow and it's the key point. Shouldn't there be a definition of which event handler captures which kind of method?

You're absolutely right—`TransactionEvent` is the key connector between the business transaction and event capture. Let me break down each line and explain how they work together:

#### Line-by-Line Analysis of Method 1

##### The Service Bean (Transaction Producer)

```kotlin
@Service
class BankingService(
    private val applicationEventPublisher: ApplicationEventPublisher,
    private val kafkaTemplate: KafkaTemplate<String, Any>
) {
```

- `ApplicationEventPublisher`: Spring's internal event bus—this is injected automatically.
    
- `KafkaTemplate`: For sending messages to Kafka topics—also auto-injected by Spring Boot.
    

```kotlin
fun processTransaction(transaction: Transaction) {
    // Business logic
    saveToDatabase(transaction)

    // Publish internal event
    applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(TransactionEvent(transaction))
}
```

Here's the key intertwining:

1. **Business action happens first**: `saveToDatabase(transaction)` - your actual banking logic.
    
2. **Event creation**: `TransactionEvent(transaction)` - wraps your transaction data in an event object.
    
3. **Event publishing**: `applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent()` - broadcasts this event internally within the Spring application.
    

##### The Event Listener Bean (Event Capture)

```kotlin
@Component
class TransactionEventListener(
    private val kafkaTemplate: KafkaTemplate<String, Any>
) {
    @EventListener
    fun handleTransactionEvent(event: TransactionEvent) {
        kafkaTemplate.send("transaction-events", event.transaction)
    }
}
```

The capture mechanism:

- `@EventListener`: This annotation tells Spring, "whenever a `TransactionEvent` is published, call this method."
    
- **Method parameter matching**: Spring automatically routes `TransactionEvent` objects to this handler.
    
- **Kafka forwarding**: Takes the captured event and sends it to your `event-store-service` via Kafka.
    

#### The TransactionEvent Definition

You're correct that `TransactionEvent` needs to be defined. It would look something like:

```kotlin
data class TransactionEvent(
    val transaction: Transaction,
    val timestamp: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(),
    val eventType: String = "TRANSACTION_PROCESSED"
)
```

This event class:

- **Carries the transaction data** from the service method.
    
- **Adds metadata** like timestamp and event type.
    
- **Serves as the contract** between the publisher and listener.
    

#### Event Handler Method Matching

##### Automatic Method Binding

Spring uses **type matching** to determine which handler captures which events:

```kotlin
// This handler ONLY captures TransactionEvent objects
@EventListener
fun handleTransactionEvent(event: TransactionEvent) { ... }

// This handler would capture AccountCreatedEvent objects
@EventListener
fun handleAccountEvent(event: AccountCreatedEvent) { ... }

// This handler captures ALL events (using ApplicationEvent base class)
@EventListener
fun handleAnyEvent(event: ApplicationEvent) { ... }
```

##### Conditional Event Handling

You can also define **conditional capturing** using SpEL expressions:

```kotlin
@EventListener(condition = "#event.transaction.amount > 1000")
fun handleLargeTransaction(event: TransactionEvent) {
    // Only captures transactions over $1000
}

@EventListener(condition = "#event.eventType == 'DEPOSIT'")
fun handleDepositOnly(event: TransactionEvent) {
    // Only captures deposit transactions
}
```

#### The Complete Flow

1. **User calls**: `bankingService.processTransaction()`
    
2. **Business logic executes**: The database is updated with the transaction.
    
3. **Event creation**: A `TransactionEvent` object is created with transaction data.
    
4. **Internal publishing**: Spring's event bus broadcasts the event.
    
5. **Automatic routing**: Spring finds all `@EventListener` methods that accept `TransactionEvent`.
    
6. **Event capture**: The listener method executes and sends the event to Kafka.
    
7. **External processing**: Your `event-store-service` receives the Kafka message.
    

#### Why This Pattern Works

- **Loose coupling**: The banking service doesn't know about Kafka or event storage.
    
- **Separation of concerns**: Business logic stays clean; event handling is separate.
    
- **Transactional safety**: If the database fails, no event is published.
    
- **Type safety**: Compile-time checking ensures events go to the correct handlers.
    
- **Extensibility**: Add more listeners without changing business code.
    

The key insight is that `TransactionEvent` acts as a data transfer object that bridges your business operation with the event capture system, while Spring's event system provides the automatic wiring between publishers and listeners based on type matching.

### At option 3, how will `OperationType` look? Tell me shortly.

`OperationType` would be a Kotlin enum class:

```kotlin
enum class OperationType {
    READ,
    WRITE
}
```

Or with more banking-specific operations:

```kotlin
enum class OperationType {
    READ,
    WRITE,
    DEPOSIT,
    WITHDRAWAL,
    TRANSFER,
    BALANCE_INQUIRY
}
```

You'd use it in your event like:

```kotlin
data class TransactionEvent(
    val transaction: Transaction,
    val operationType: OperationType
)
```

Then publish events with:

```kotlin
applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(
    TransactionEvent(transaction, OperationType.WRITE)
)
```

### I can't understand `#event.operationType.name() == 'READ'`. What are `name()` and `#event`?

Let me break down the confusing parts of `#event.operationType.name() == 'READ'` for you:

#### What is `#event`?

`#event` is a SpEL (Spring Expression Language) variable that refers to the event object being processed in your `@EventListener` method.

When Spring processes your event listener:

```kotlin
@EventListener(condition = "#event.operationType.name() == 'READ'")
fun handleReadOperation(event: TransactionEvent) { ... }
```

The `#event` automatically refers to the `TransactionEvent` object that was published. It's like having direct access to the `event` parameter inside the condition expression.

#### What is `name()`?

`name()` is a built-in method of Java Enums that returns the exact string representation of the enum constant.

For your `OperationType` enum:

```kotlin
enum class OperationType {
    READ,
    WRITE
}
```

- `OperationType.READ.name()` returns the string `"READ"`.
    
- `OperationType.WRITE.name()` returns the string `"WRITE"`.
    

The `name()` method is `final` and cannot be overridden, which makes it perfect for precise comparisons in conditions.

#### How the Complete Expression Works

Breaking down `#event.operationType.name() == 'READ'`:

1. **`#event`**: References the `TransactionEvent` object.
    
2. **.operationType**: Accesses the `operationType` property of the event.
    
3. **.name()**: Calls the enum's `name()` method to get the string representation.
    
4. **== 'READ'**: Compares that string with the literal `'READ'`.
    

#### SpEL Context in Event Listeners

SpEL (Spring Expression Language) is used in the `condition` attribute of `@EventListener` to make event handling conditional. The expression must evaluate to:

- `true` (boolean)
    
- Or string values: `"true"`, `"on"`, `"yes"`, or `"1"`
    

#### Alternative Ways to Write the Same Condition

You could also write this condition using different SpEL approaches:

```kotlin
// Using enum comparison with T() operator
@EventListener(condition = "#event.operationType == T(com.yourpackage.OperationType).READ")

// Using toString() method (less reliable)
@EventListener(condition = "#event.operationType.toString() == 'READ'")
```

However, using `name()` is the most reliable approach because it always returns the exact enum constant name, regardless of any custom `toString()` implementations.

The key insight is that `#event` gives you access to your event object's properties within the SpEL condition, allowing you to create sophisticated filtering logic for which events should be processed by specific handlers.

### So, because `fun handleReadOperation(event: TransactionEvent)` means this method handles an event of type `TransactionEvent`, calling `#event` means referencing an instance of that `TransactionEvent` type thing?

Yes, exactly!

`#event` in the SpEL condition directly references the **same** `TransactionEvent` instance that gets passed to the `handleReadOperation(event: TransactionEvent)` method parameter.

#### How It Works

When Spring processes your event listener:

```kotlin
@EventListener(condition = "#event.operationType.name() == 'READ'")
fun handleReadOperation(event: TransactionEvent) { ... }
```

Before the method executes:

1. Spring evaluates the condition using the `TransactionEvent` instance.
    
2. `#event` refers to that specific `TransactionEvent` object.
    
3. If the condition is `true`, Spring calls `handleReadOperation()`.
    
4. The **same** `TransactionEvent` instance gets passed as the `event` parameter.
    

#### Key Point

`#event` in the condition and the `event` parameter are **the exact same object instance**—just accessed at different stages:

- `#event`: Used during condition evaluation (before method call).
    
- `event` parameter: Used inside the method body (after method call).
    

#### Alternative Syntax

You could also write conditions using the parameter name:

```kotlin
@EventListener(condition = "#root.args[0].operationType.name() == 'READ'")
fun handleReadOperation(event: TransactionEvent) { ... }
```

But `#event` is cleaner, and Spring automatically provides this variable name for event listener conditions.

### Tell me more about SpEL.

#### Spring Expression Language (SpEL) - Complete Guide

##### What is SpEL?

Spring Expression Language (SpEL) is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating object graphs at runtime. It's designed specifically for the Spring ecosystem but can also be used independently of the Spring Framework.

SpEL provides a unified expression language across all Spring portfolio products, offering capabilities similar to other expression languages like OGNL, MVEL, and JBoss EL, but with Spring-specific optimizations and integrations.

##### Core Syntax and Basic Usage

###### Expression Syntax Patterns

SpEL expressions use specific syntax patterns depending on their context:

- **In annotations**: `@Value("#{expression}")`
    
- **In XML configuration**: `#{expression}`
    
- **Property references**: `${property.name}`
    
- **Combined usage**: `#{${someProperty} + 2}`
    

###### Basic Data Types and Literals

|Expression|Result|Type|
|---|---|---|
|`'Hello World'`|"Hello World"|String|
|`true`|true|Boolean|
|`null`|null|Null|
|`{}`|empty list|List[Unknown]|
|`{1,2,3,4}`|list of integers|List[Integer]|
|`{john:300, alex:400}`|record/map|Record|

#### Comprehensive Feature Set

SpEL supports an extensive range of functionality:

##### Operators and Expressions

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `div`, `mod`
    
- **Relational Operators**: `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `lt`, `gt`, `eq`, `ne`, `le`, `ge`
    
- **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`, `&&`, `||`, `!`
    
- **Conditional Operators**: `?:` (ternary), Elvis operator
    
- **String Operators**: concatenation, regex matching with `matches`
    

##### Advanced Capabilities

- **Method Invocation**: Call methods on objects within expressions.
    
- **Static Method Access**: Using `T()` operator for static methods.
    
- **Property Access**: Direct access to object properties.
    
- **Collection Operations**: Projection, selection, and manipulation.
    
- **Constructor Invocation**: Create new objects.
    
- **Bean References**: Access Spring-managed beans.
    
- **Variables**: Define and use custom variables.
    
- **User-defined Functions**: Create custom functions.
    

#### Practical Examples

##### Static Method Calls

```kotlin
@Value("#{T(java.lang.Math).random() * 100}")
private double randomValue

@Value("#{T(java.lang.Math).sqrt(144)}")
private double squareRoot // Results in 12.0
```

##### Bean Property Access

```kotlin
@Component
class Employee {
    val salary = 50000
}

@Component
class SalaryCalculator {
    @Value("#{employee.salary + 10000}")
    private int revisedSalary // Results in 60000
}
```

##### System Properties Access

```kotlin
@Value("#{systemProperties['user.name']}")
private String userName
```

#### SpEL in Event Listeners

##### Conditional Event Processing

SpEL is particularly powerful when used with `@EventListener` annotations for conditional event processing:

```kotlin
@EventListener(condition = "#event.operationType.name() == 'READ'")
fun handleReadOperation(event: TransactionEvent) { ... }

@EventListener(condition = "#event.success")
fun handleSuccessfulEvent(event: GenericEvent) { ... }

@EventListener(condition = "#event.amount > 1000")
fun handleLargeTransaction(event: TransactionEvent) { ... }
```

##### Event Variables and Context

In `@EventListener` contexts, SpEL provides special variables:

- **`#event`**: References the event object being processed.
    
- **`#root`**: References the root context object.
    
- **Bean references**: Access other Spring beans using `@beanName` syntax.
    

##### Environment-Based Conditional Listeners

```kotlin
@EventListener(condition = "@environment.getProperty('listeners.enabled')")
fun conditionalListener(event: SomeEvent) {
    // Only executes if property is true
}
```

#### SpEL API Components

The SpEL framework consists of several key components:

- **`Expression` (Interface)**: Represents a parsed expression.
    
- **`ExpressionParser` (Interface)**: Parses expression strings.
    
- **`SpelExpressionParser` (Class)**: Default implementation of `ExpressionParser`.
    
- **`EvaluationContext` (Interface)**: Provides context for expression evaluation.
    
- **`StandardEvaluationContext` (Class)**: Default evaluation context implementation.
    

#### Use Cases in Spring Applications

- **Configuration Injection**: SpEL enables dynamic value injection in Spring configurations, allowing runtime calculation of values rather than static configuration.
    
- **Security Expressions**: Spring Security extensively uses SpEL for method-level security and access control expressions.
    
- **Spring Data JPA**: SpEL can be used in custom query definitions to make queries more dynamic and hide database-specific operations.
    
- **Caching**: Spring's caching abstraction uses SpEL for dynamic cache key generation and conditional caching strategies.
    

#### Performance and Best Practices

- **Compile expressions once**: For frequently used expressions, parse and compile them once rather than repeatedly.
    
- **Use appropriate evaluation contexts**: Choose between `StandardEvaluationContext` and `SimpleEvaluationContext` based on security needs.
    
- **Cache compiled expressions**: Store compiled expressions for reuse in performance-critical applications.
    
- **Limit expression complexity**: Keep expressions simple and readable for maintainability.
    

SpEL provides Spring developers with a powerful tool for dynamic configuration and runtime object manipulation, making it essential for building flexible and configurable Spring applications.

### Let's review—when we do a transaction with Kafka, we use event-sourcing for saving transaction information which will be saved into MongoDB by, for example, defining an event handler. Am I right?

Yes, you're absolutely correct! Let me break down your understanding to confirm each part:

#### Your Understanding is Spot-On

**Transaction with Kafka + Event Sourcing + MongoDB** - this is exactly how your banking system architecture works.

#### The Complete Flow

1. **Business Transaction Occurs**: Your banking service processes a transaction (deposit, withdrawal, transfer).
    
2. **Event Sourcing Pattern**: Instead of just updating the current state, the system captures the transaction as an immutable event.
    
3. **Kafka Integration**: The event gets published to Kafka topics for reliable, distributed messaging.
    
4. **Event Handler Processing**: Your `event-store-service` has event handlers (like `@KafkaListener` methods) that consume these events.
    
5. **MongoDB Persistence**: The event handler saves the complete event information to MongoDB as permanent, immutable records.
    

#### Why This Architecture Works for Banking

##### Event Sourcing Benefits

- **Complete audit trail**: Every transaction is permanently recorded.
    
- **State reconstruction**: Can rebuild account balances by replaying events.
    
- **Regulatory compliance**: Banks need detailed transaction histories.
    
- **Time travel**: View account state at any point in history.
    

##### Kafka Benefits

- **Reliable messaging**: Ensures events aren't lost during processing.
    
- **Scalability**: Multiple services can consume the same events.
    
- **Decoupling**: Banking services don't directly depend on the event store.
    

##### MongoDB Benefits

- **Flexible schema**: Can store diverse event types without a rigid structure.
    
- **Document storage**: Events naturally map to JSON documents.
    
- **Query capabilities**: Easy to search and analyze stored events.
    

#### Implementation Pattern

Your approach using **event handlers** is the standard pattern:

```kotlin
@KafkaListener(topics = ["banking-events"])
fun handleBankingEvent(event: BankingEvent) {
    // Save to MongoDB event store
    eventRepository.save(event.toDocument())
}
```

#### The Key Insight

You've correctly identified that **event handlers are the bridge** between Kafka (messaging) and MongoDB (storage) in your event sourcing architecture. This creates a robust, scalable system where:

- **No transaction data is lost** (thanks to Kafka persistence).
    
- **A complete history is maintained** (thanks to event sourcing).
    
- **Data is queryable and analyzable** (thanks to MongoDB storage).
    

This is exactly how enterprise banking systems implement reliable transaction processing with full audit capabilities!

## Summary

**Event Sourcing Pattern**

- Persists a full history of changes as an immutable sequence of events.
    
- Core principles: Immutable event log, state reconstruction, complete audit trail, and time-travel.
    
- Works with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to separate write (command) and read (query) operations.
    

**System Architecture: Event Sourcing with Kafka & Spring**

- **Transaction Flow**:
    
    1. A business service (`@Service`) processes a transaction.
        
    2. An immutable event representing the transaction is created.
        
    3. The event is published to a Kafka topic.
        
    4. An event handler service (`event-store-service`) consumes the event from Kafka.
        
    5. The handler persists the event to a database (e.g., MongoDB).
        

**Spring Implementation Patterns for Event Capture**

- **Application Events (Cleanest Approach)**:
    
    - A `@Service` bean uses `ApplicationEventPublisher` to publish an event internally.
        
    - A separate `@Component` bean with an `@EventListener` method captures this event and sends it to Kafka.
        
    - This decouples business logic from the messaging infrastructure.
        
- **Transactional Event Listeners**:
    
    - Use `@TransactionalEventListener(phase = TransactionPhase.AFTER_COMMIT)` to ensure an event is sent to Kafka only after the associated database transaction successfully commits.
        
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**:
    
    - An `@Aspect` can intercept calls to `@Service` methods and publish events, separating the concern of event publication entirely from the business logic.
        

**Spring Expression Language (SpEL)**

- A powerful language for querying and manipulating objects at runtime.
    
- Syntax: `#{expression}`.
    
- **Use in Event Listeners**: `condition` attribute of `@EventListener` uses SpEL for conditional event handling.
    
- **Key Variables**:
    
    - `#event`: Refers to the event object being processed.
        
    - `T()`: Accesses static methods and enums (e.g., `T(com.yourpackage.OperationType).READ`).
        
- **Enum Comparison**: The `.name()` method on an enum provides a reliable string representation for conditions (e.g., `#event.operationType.name() == 'READ'`).
