#### Tech Stacks Specification





Based on the diagrams you've provided, I can see several important architectural patterns that should be incorporated into your banking system design:

#### Event-Driven Architecture Pattern

Based on the first diagram showing the flow between components like APP, BankMetrics, Micrometer, Prometheus, and Grafana, your architecture should emphasize:

- **Monitoring and Metrics Collection**: Integration with Micrometer for application metrics
    
- **Time-Series Data Storage**: Prometheus for metrics storage
    
- **Visualization Layer**: Grafana for dashboards and monitoring
    
- **Application Performance Monitoring**: Real-time system health tracking
    

#### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern

From the second diagram showing the separation between "계좌 생성" (Account Creation) and "계좌 조회" (Account Inquiry), your architecture should implement:

- **Write Operations**: Separate path for commands (account creation, transactions)
    
- **Read Operations**: Optimized path for queries (balance checks, transaction history)
    
- **Event Store**: Central event storage for maintaining system state
    
- **Read Models**: Optimized data structures for query operations

### I need an explanation of why each module/component of this architecture is needed

Here's a comprehensive explanation of why each module and component is essential for a robust, scalable banking application.

#### Presentation Layer

- **Customer Web App**: The primary interface for banking customers. It is needed to provide a secure, user-friendly experience for account management, transfers, and viewing transaction history.
    
- **Admin Panel**: The administrative interface for bank staff. It is needed for operational control, managing customer accounts, monitoring transactions for compliance, and risk management.
    

#### API Gateway Layer

- **Load Balancer & API Gateway**: The single entry point for all API requests. It is needed to centralize security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting), distribute requests for performance and scalability, and manage API versions.
    

#### Command Side (Write Operations)

- **Account, Transaction, Auth, Loan WriteAPIs**: These handle all operations that modify data. They are needed to ensure data integrity, apply business rules consistently, and maintain an audit trail for all changes.
    
- **Event Store**: The central repository for all banking events. It is needed to provide an immutable audit trail of all system changes, enable system state reconstruction (event replay), and facilitate debugging and data recovery.
    

#### Query Side (Read Operations)

- **Account, Transaction, Auth, Loan ReadAPIs**: These are optimized interfaces for retrieving data. They are needed to provide fast, scalable access to data without impacting the performance of write operations, supporting quick reporting and data retrieval for the UI.
    

#### Monitoring & Observability Layer

- **Micrometer (Metrics)**: Collects application metrics. It is needed for performance monitoring, identifying bottlenecks, and providing data for proactive alerting and capacity planning.
    
- **Prometheus (Storage)**: A time-series database. It is needed to store historical performance data for trend analysis, complex querying, and triggering alerts.
    
- **Grafana (Dashboard)**: A visualization platform. It is needed for real-time monitoring of system health through dashboards, visual alerts, and business intelligence reporting.
    
- **Audit Service**: Manages comprehensive logging and audit trails. It is needed for regulatory compliance, security forensics, and generating reports for authorities.
    

#### Data Layer

- **PostgreSQL (Primary)**: The primary relational database. It is needed for its ACID compliance and reliability, which are critical for ensuring the consistency of financial transactions.
    
- **Redis (Cache)**: An in-memory data store. It is needed to dramatically improve response times by caching frequently accessed data, managing user sessions, and implementing rate limiting.
    
- **MongoDB (Events)**: A document database. Its flexible schema and scalability make it ideal for storing the diverse event structures generated by the Event Store.
    
- **Kafka (Messages)**: A message streaming platform. It is needed to decouple services through asynchronous communication, handle high-throughput event processing, and ensure reliable message delivery between system components.
