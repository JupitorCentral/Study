BankForge Project: Module Dependencies and Architecture

### Can you explain the dependencies and relationships between the modules in the BankForge project?

Yes, there are extensive dependencies and relations between the modules. The BankForge banking system is designed with a highly interconnected architecture where modules work together through well-defined relationships. Here's how they're connected:

#### Core Module Dependencies

##### Command-Query Module Pairs

The system uses the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** pattern, creating natural dependencies between write and read operations:

- `account-command-service` → `account-query-service`: Account creation events flow to query models.
    
- `transaction-command-service` → `transaction-query-service`: Transaction writes trigger read model updates.
    
- `auth-service`: Provides authentication for both command and query operations.
    

##### Event Store as Central Hub

The `event-store-service` acts as the central nervous system:

- All command services depend on it to persist events.
    
- All query services depend on it to rebuild read models.
    
- Provides the single source of truth for system state.
    

#### Cross-Module Communication Flow

##### Authentication Dependencies

`auth-service` → ALL other modules

- Validates JWT tokens for every request.
    
- Provides user context and permissions.
    
- Enables role-based access control (RBAC).
    

##### Event-Driven Dependencies

The modules communicate through **Kafka message streaming**:

#### Shared Infrastructure Dependencies

##### Common Utilities

The `shared-common` module provides:

- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used across all services.
    
- Common utilities and helper functions.
    
- Validation rules and business logic.
    
- Error handling patterns.
    

##### Database Layer Relations

Each module depends on different databases for specific purposes:

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for account and transaction commands.
    
- **Redis**: Session management and caching for all modules.
    
- **MongoDB**: Event storage accessed by `event-store-service`.
    
- **Kafka**: Message streaming between all services.
    

#### Monitoring and Observability Dependencies

##### Metrics Collection Chain

The `monitoring-service` depends on:

- **Micrometer** for collecting metrics from all other modules.
    
- **Prometheus** for storing performance data.
    
- **Grafana** for real-time visualization.
    

#### Business Logic Dependencies

##### Transaction Processing Flow

```
Customer Request → API Gateway → Auth Service
                                     ↓
                       transaction-command-service
                                     ↓
                                Event Store
                                     ↓
                               Kafka Messages
                                     ↓
                       transaction-query-service
                                     ↓
                           Updated Balance Display
```

##### Loan Processing Dependencies

Loan operations require coordination between multiple modules:

- `auth-service`: User authentication and authorization.
    
- `account-query-service`: Checking account balances and history.
    
- `transaction-command-service`: Processing loan disbursements.
    
- `notification-service`: Sending approval/rejection alerts.
    

#### Notification System Dependencies

The `notification-service` depends on events from:

- `transaction-command-service`: Transaction completion alerts.
    
- `account-command-service`: Account status changes.
    
- `auth-service`: Security-related notifications.
    
- `Event Store`: Real-time event streaming for instant notifications.
    

#### API Gateway Dependencies

The **Load Balancer/API Gateway** orchestrates all module interactions:

- Routes requests to appropriate command or query services.
    
- Enforces authentication through `auth-service`.
    
- Implements rate limiting across all modules.
    
- Manages API versioning for backward compatibility.
    

#### Real-Time Features Dependencies

##### WebSocket Connections


```
Customer Interface → WebSocket → notification-service
                                        ↓
                                Event Store Listeners
                                        ↓
                               Real-time Updates
```

#### Development and Deployment Dependencies

##### Build System Relations

The multi-module Maven/Gradle structure creates:

- A parent project managing all 8 modules.
    
- Shared dependencies across modules.
    
- Unified deployment as a single JAR file.
    
- Module-specific configurations while maintaining cohesion.
    

This interconnected architecture ensures that while modules are **loosely coupled** through event-driven communication, they work together seamlessly. The dependencies are designed to maintain scalability while ensuring data consistency and real-time performance.

### Can you create a simplified textual diagram of the core Spring Boot modules and their relationships?

#### Module Relationships

**Core Dependencies**

- `shared-common` → All other modules (base utilities and DTOs)
    
- `auth-service` → All other modules (authentication and authorization)
    

**CQRS Pattern Flow**

```
Command Services → event-store-service → Query Services
```

**Event-Driven Communication**

![[Screenshot 2025-07-16 at 1.00.45 PM.png|600]]

**Cross-Module Dependencies**

- **Command Services** depend on `event-store-service` for event persistence.
    
- **Query Services** depend on `event-store-service` for read model updates.
    
- `notification-service` depends on events from all command services.
    
- `monitoring-service` observes all modules for metrics and health.
    

This simplified diagram focuses purely on the Spring Boot modules within the root project, showing their hierarchical dependencies and event-driven relationships while excluding external infrastructure components.

### Summary

**Core Architectural Patterns**

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separates write operations (Commands) from read operations (Queries).
    
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Modules communicate asynchronously through events, with Kafka as the message broker.
    

**Central Hub Module**

- **event-store-service**: Acts as the single source of truth, persisting all events from command services and feeding data to query services.
    

**Key Module Roles & Dependencies**

- **shared-common**: A foundational module providing DTOs, utilities, and validation logic to all other services.
    
- **auth-service**: A cross-cutting concern providing security (JWT, RBAC) to the entire system.
    
- **Command Services** (`account-command-service`, `transaction-command-service`): Handle all data modification requests (write operations).
    
- **Query Services** (`account-query-service`, `transaction-query-service`): Handle all data retrieval requests (read operations) and build their models from the event store.
    
- **notification-service**: Listens to events to send real-time alerts and notifications.
    
- **monitoring-service**: Observes all modules to collect metrics for health checks and performance visualization.
    

**Primary Data and Communication Flow**

- **Command Flow**: `Command Service` → `Event Store`
    
- **Query Flow**: `Event Store` → `Query Service`
    
- **Universal Dependencies**: All modules rely on `shared-common` for common code and `auth-service` for security.
