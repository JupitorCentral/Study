# Resolving `postgres-mcp` Connection Closed Error

This summary outlines the process of debugging and resolving the `McpError: MCP error -32000: Connection closed` when setting up a `postgres-mcp` server for an AI agent. The core issue was identified as an incorrect execution method for the installed Python package.

### **Crucial Part of the Solution**

The key breakthrough was realizing that the installed `postgres-mcp` package (version 0.3.0) is not meant to be executed directly as a module (`python -m postgres_mcp`) or as a standard command-line tool.

The correct and final solution was to use the `uv` runner to execute the package within its project context. This was achieved by updating the `~/.claude.json` configuration file as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", "/Users/{username}/Projects/postgres-mcp-project",
        "run",
        "postgres-mcp",
        "--access-mode=unrestricted"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URI": "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Error Meaning**: The error `MCP error -32000: Connection closed` indicates that the client (Claude Code) successfully started the MCP server process, but the server terminated immediately. This usually points to a configuration or execution environment problem, not a network connectivity issue.
    
- **Package Execution Varies**: Not all Python packages are executed in the same way. The initial attempt, `python -m postgres_mcp`, failed because the package does not have a `__main__.py` file, making it non-executable as a module.
    
- **Identify the Right Tool**: The `postgres-mcp` package you installed is designed to be invoked by a runner. The successful solution used `uv run`, which correctly handles the execution of scripts and packages within a specified project directory and virtual environment.
    
- **Verification Steps**: The debugging process involved systematically checking:
    
    1. The Python path and module installation (`pip list`).
        
    2. Different execution methods (`python -m`, `which`).
        
    3. Finally, using a dedicated package runner (`uv run`). This systematic approach is crucial for diagnosing similar issues.
