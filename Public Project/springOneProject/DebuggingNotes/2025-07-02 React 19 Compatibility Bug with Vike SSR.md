This debugging session identified and resolved a critical performance issue where the browser would freeze and CPU usage would spike to 100% upon clicking any input field. The root cause was determined to be a **compatibility issue between the newly released React 19 and the Vike SSR framework**.

### Summary of the Debugging Process

The initial problem was observed on a specific `/healthCare` page when trying to type in an email input. The debugging process explored several potential causes, which turned out to be red herrings:

- Incorrect `useCallback` dependencies and inline arrow functions causing re-renders.
    
- Inefficient use of `useState` lazy initialization.
    
- Type mismatches between mock data and TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `id` as `number` vs. `string`).
    
- Potential circular dependencies from splitting a large component file.
    
- Issues with `shadcn/ui` components versus native HTML inputs.
    

The breakthrough occurred when a **minimal test page (`/testpage`)** with a single basic input element was created, and the freezing issue **still occurred**. This proved the problem was not with the page's components but was a global issue related to the project's environment and dependencies.

The investigation then shifted to the project's setup, revealing the use of **React 19**. Given its recent release, it was suspected to have compatibility problems with the Vike SSR framework's event handling and hydration logic.

### The Crucial Solution

The definitive solution was to **downgrade React from the "bleeding-edge" version 19 to the latest stable version 18**.

This involved:

1. Uninstalling the existing React 19 packages.
    
2. Installing stable versions: `react@^18.3.1`, `react-dom@^18.3.1`, and their corresponding `@types` packages.
    
3. Resolving peer dependency conflicts by performing a clean installation of all packages (`rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`).
    

After downgrading to React 18, the input-related browser freezing was completely resolved on all pages.

### Key Points to Remember

- **Suspect the Environment First:** When a strange, hard-to-trace bug affects multiple components or routes (especially after ruling out simple component logic errors), investigate the environment, build tools, and core dependencies.
    
- **Isolate the Problem:** Creating a minimal reproducible example (like the simple `/testpage`) is one of the most effective debugging techniques to confirm if the issue is global or component-specific.
    
- **Beware of Bleeding-Edge Versions:** Using the latest major versions of core frameworks (like React) in a complex stack (e.g., with SSR) can introduce compatibility bugs. Sticking to stable, widely-used versions for production is often safer.
    
- **Type Mismatches are a Symptom, Not Always the Cause:** While fixing type inconsistencies is important for code quality, they might not always be the root of severe performance issues like browser freezes.
