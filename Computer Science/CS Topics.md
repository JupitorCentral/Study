### Core Relational Model and SQL Mastery

#### 1. Relational Data Model Fundamentals

- [ ] **Definitions**: Be able to clearly define:
  - [ ] **Relation (Table)**: A collection of data organized into rows and columns.
  - [ ] **Tuple (Row)**: A single record in a table.
  - [ ] **Attribute (Column)**: A named column representing a property.
  - [ ] **Domain**: The set of allowed values for an attribute.

- [ ] **Keys (Critical)**: Understand and differentiate:
  - [ ] **Superkey**: Uniquely identifies a tuple.
  - [ ] **Candidate Key**: A minimal superkey. A relation can have multiple candidate keys.
  - [ ] **Primary Key**: The chosen candidate key to uniquely identify tuples, often underlined. Every relation schema should have one.
  - [ ] **Foreign Key**: Attribute(s) in one table that refer to the primary key of another table, linking them and enforcing referential integrity. Be aware of `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` actions like `CASCADE` and `SET NULL`.
  - [ ] **Prime vs. Nonprime Attributes**: An attribute is prime if it's part of _any_ candidate key.

- [ ] **NULL Values**: Understand their meanings (unknown, not applicable, value withheld) and that SQL does not distinguish between them.

#### 2. SQL (Structured Query Language)

- [ ] **DDL (Data Definition Language)**:
  - [ ] `CREATE TABLE`: Know how to define tables with attribute names, data types (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `TIME`), and constraints: `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, and `CHECK`.
  - [ ] `ALTER TABLE` (add/drop columns).
  - [ ] `DROP TABLE`.

- [ ] **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: This requires **hands-on practice**.
  - [ ] **`SELECT` (Basic Retrieval)**: Master the `SELECT-FROM-WHERE` structure. Understand projection (what columns to show) and selection (what rows to filter).
  - [ ] **Operators**: Basic comparison (`=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `<>`), `LIKE` (with `%`, `_`, `ESCAPE`), `BETWEEN`.
  - [ ] **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`. Understand `DISTINCT` within `COUNT`.
  - [ ] **`GROUP BY` and `HAVING`**: Use `GROUP BY` to partition tuples and `HAVING` to filter these groups based on aggregate conditions.
  - [ ] **Joins**: Focus on `INNER JOIN` logic, either with `WHERE` conditions or the `JOIN` keyword. Understand the need for aliases when joining a table to itself.
  - [ ] **Nested Queries**: Understand `IN`, `EXISTS`, and `NOT EXISTS` and their use with subqueries, especially correlated ones.
  - [ ] `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`: General understanding of their purpose.

- [ ] **Views**: Know their basic purpose (simplified access, security).
- [ ] **Prioritize**: Writing and understanding `SELECT` statements with various clauses. Practice joins and subqueries.

### Database Design Principles & Performance Basics

#### 3. Database Design Process & ER Model (Conceptual Design)

- [ ] **Design Process Overview**: Know the phases: requirements, conceptual design, logical design, physical design.

- [ ] **ER Model (Conceptual Modeling Tool)**:
  - [ ] **Purpose**: Used for high-level conceptual design, independent of a specific DBMS.
  - [ ] **Key Concepts**:
    - [ ] **Entities, Attributes, Relationships**: How real-world concepts are mapped.
    - [ ] **Attribute Types**: Simple, composite, multivalued (how they differ).
    - [ ] **Relationship Types**: Binary vs. Ternary (higher degree).
    - [ ] **Structural Constraints**: Crucially, **Cardinality Ratios** (1:1, 1:N, M:N) and **Participation Constraints** (total/existence dependency vs. partial). Be able to draw and interpret their common notation (1, M, N, single/double lines).
    - [ ] **Weak Entity Types**: Identify a weak entity, its owner, identifying relationship, and partial key.

#### 4. Normalization Theory (Relational Schema Quality)

- [ ] **Informal Design Guidelines**: Understand the goals: clear semantics, reducing redundancy, minimizing NULL values, and avoiding spurious tuples.
- [ ] **Update Anomalies**: Be able to explain insertion, deletion, and modification anomalies and _why_ they are problematic. This is a direct consequence of poor normalization.
- [ ] **Functional Dependencies (FDs)**: Understand X â†’ Y means X uniquely determines Y. FDs are properties of the schema, not just a specific data state.

- [ ] **Normal Forms (Conceptual Understanding)**:
  - [ ] **1NF**: Deals with atomic values (no multivalued attributes).
  - [ ] **2NF**: Deals with partial dependencies of nonprime attributes on a primary key.
  - [ ] **3NF**: Deals with transitive dependencies of nonprime attributes on a primary key.
  - [ ] **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: A stricter form of 3NF, generally desirable. Understand that it aims to eliminate all FDs where the left-hand side is not a superkey.

- [ ] **Key takeaway**: Normalization reduces redundancy and anomalies, leading to a better database design.

#### 5. Physical Storage and Indexing (High-Level)

  - [ ] **Types (conceptual)**: Primary, Clustering, Secondary. Know they exist and serve different purposes based on file organization and uniqueness of the indexed field.
  - [ ] **B+-trees**: Focus on understanding that they are the most common multilevel index. Know their key characteristics: **balanced, dynamic, efficient for both equality and range queries**. Understand why they are generally preferred over B-trees (more entries in internal nodes, fewer levels for the same data size).

#### 6. Query Processing and Optimization (High-Level)

- [ ] **Goal**: The DBMS aims to find a _reasonably efficient_ execution plan for a query, not necessarily the absolute optimal one (too complex/time-consuming).
- [ ] **Conceptual Execution Order**: `FROM` -> `WHERE` -> `GROUP BY` -> `HAVING` -> `SELECT` -> `ORDER BY`. This is crucial for understanding how SQL queries are processed.

Emphasize the importance of its randomized version, which helps ensure good average performance across all inputs.
- [ ] **Merge Sort**: Offers a consistent O(n log n) running time in both worst-case and average-case scenarios. It's a classic example of divide-and-conquer.
- [ ] **Linear-Time Sorting Algorithms**: Be aware of algorithms like Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort that can sort in O(n) time under specific assumptions about the input data (e.g., integers in a small range or uniformly distributed data). This demonstrates that the O(n log n) lower bound for comparison sorts can be "beaten" when these assumptions hold.
