### "Transition" as a Verb

Here's why:

- **"Its state"** acts as the subject of the sentence, referring to the process's current condition.
- **"would transition"** is the verb phrase, indicating the action that the state performs. It means "to change from one state to another."

The sources use similar verb forms when discussing changes in process states:

- "As a process executes, it **changes** state."
- "In the first two cases, the process eventually **switches** from the waiting state to the ready state..."
- "...the thread **is moved** from the waiting state to the ready state..."

### "Transition" as a Noun

"Transition" can also function as a **noun**. When used as a noun, it refers to the _act or process of changing_ from one state or condition to another.

### Examples

- **As a verb:** "The process's state **will transition** from ready to running."
- **As a noun:** "The **transition** from the running state to the waiting state is an important part of context switching." (Here, "transition" is a noun, the subject of the sentence, and "is" is the verb).

So, in your original sentence, "Its state would transition," **"transition" is correctly used as a verb**.
