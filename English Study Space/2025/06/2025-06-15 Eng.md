	### The Problem with the Original Sentence
	
	The sentence "Thomas Frank has given the deal to take Mathys Tell to Spurs his approval" has a structural issue. The phrase "his approval" is ambiguously placed and creates confusion about what exactly Thomas Frank has given.
	
	### Why Your Test Makes Sense
	
	Your reasoning is spot-on. If we rearrange it to "They have given Frank the deal to take Mathys Tell to Spurs his approval," it becomes even more obviously wrong, which confirms the original sentence's grammatical problems.
	
	### Possible Intended Meanings
	
	The sentence likely meant one of these:
	
	1. **"Thomas Frank has given his approval for the deal to take Mathys Tell to Spurs"**
	    
	2. **"Thomas Frank has approved the deal to take Mathys Tell to Spurs"**
	    
	3. **"Thomas Frank has given the deal his approval to take Mathys Tell to Spurs"**
	    
	### The Core Issue
	
	The problem is that "the deal to take Mathys Tell to Spurs" and "his approval" are competing for the same grammatical position as the direct object of "has given." This creates ambiguity about what exactly was given and to whom.
