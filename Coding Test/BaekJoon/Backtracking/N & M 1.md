Of course! As a competitive programming expert, I'd be happy to review your solution for the "N and M (1)" problem.

### N and M (1) Problem Review

Here is a breakdown of the problem and your solution.

### Problem Summary

The goal is to find all possible sequences of length **M** that can be formed by picking **M** distinct numbers from the set of natural numbers from 1 to **N**. The resulting sequences must be printed in lexicographical (dictionary) order.

For example, if N=4 and M=2, you need to find all 2-number sequences using numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4} without repetition, like "1 2", "1 3", "1 4", "2 1", etc.

### Your Solution Code

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class Main {

    static ArrayList<Integer> arr;
    static int n;
    static int m;
    static StringBuilder sb;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out));
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
        sb = new StringBuilder();
        
        n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());

        arr = new ArrayList<>();
        find (0);

        bw.write(sb.toString());
        bw.close();
    }

    public static void find (int idx) {
        if (arr.size() == m) {
            for (Integer x : arr) {
                sb.append(x).append(" ");
            }
            sb.append("\n");
        }

        for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            if (!arr.contains(i)) {
                arr.add(i);
                find(i);
                arr.remove(arr.size()-1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### How Your Solution Works

Your code correctly implements a **backtracking** algorithm, which is a perfect fit for this kind of problem. 👏

1. **Initialization**: You read `N` and `M`, and initialize an `ArrayList` named `arr` to store the numbers for the current sequence.
    
2. **Recursive Function `find`**: This is the core of your solution. It's designed to build a sequence number by number.
    
    - **Base Case**: The recursion stops when a sequence of the desired length `M` is formed (`arr.size() == m`). At this point, the completed sequence is appended to a `StringBuilder` for later output.
        
    - **Recursive Step**: The function loops through all possible numbers from 1 to `N`.
        
        - **Check for Duplicates**: `if (!arr.contains(i))` is the key check. It ensures that the number `i` is not already in the current sequence, satisfying the problem's "without repetition" condition.
            
        - **Explore**: If the number is not a duplicate, it's added to the list (`arr.add(i)`).
            
        - **Recurse**: It then calls `find` again to determine the _next_ number in the sequence.
            
        - **Backtrack**: After the recursive call returns (meaning all possibilities starting with the current prefix have been explored), `arr.remove(arr.size()-1)` removes the last number. This "backtracking" step is crucial, as it allows the loop to continue and try the next number (e.g., after exploring "1 2", it backtracks to "1" to then explore "1 3").
            

The `find(i)` call works, but the parameter `idx` isn't actually used. The logic relies entirely on `arr.size()` and `arr.contains()`, which is a valid approach.

### Suggested Modifications

Your solution works perfectly for the given constraints (N ≤ 8). However, the `arr.contains(i)` check can be inefficient on a larger scale. Checking for an element in an `ArrayList` takes time proportional to the list's size (O(M)).

For better performance, you can use a **boolean array** to keep track of which numbers have been used. This check becomes an O(1) operation, which is much faster.

Here's how you can modify the code:

1. **Add a `visited` array:**
    
    ```java
    // ... inside the Main class
    static boolean[] visited; 
    // ... inside the main method
    visited = new boolean[n + 1]; // To use indices 1 through n
    ```
    
2. **Update the `find` function:**
    
    ```java
    public static void find () { // The parameter is no longer needed
        if (arr.size() == m) {
            // ... (same as before)
            return; // Good practice to return after base case
        }
    
        for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) { // O(1) check
                visited[i] = true;  // Mark as used
                arr.add(i);
                find();
                arr.remove(arr.size()-1); // Backtrack (clear path)
                visited[i] = false; // Un-mark so it can be used in other permutations
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    And you would start the process by simply calling `find()` in your `main` method.
    

This `visited` array approach is the standard and most efficient way to solve permutation problems using backtracking.
